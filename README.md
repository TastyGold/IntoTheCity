## Description
This is a medium-length, beginner-difficulty map with lots of strawberries to collect along the way.

Details:
- 35+ rooms
- 21 strawberries

After enduring 3+ years of development limbo, Into the City has finally reached its 2.0.0 release!

Highly technical speedrun movement is NOT required in any sense. This map can be beaten by players of any skill level and be enjoyed.

This map is catered to be beginner friendly whilst also allowing for creative movement and skips to appeal to more advanced players.

Feedback is welcome and encouraged, as this is my first map to see a full completion and release.

Give it a try! :)
