[THEO right normal]
Hey, {# F94A4A}Strawberry{#}.
[MADELINE left normal]
I'm glad you could make it.
[THEO right thinking]
A chance to explore a {~}mysterious abandoned {n}city{/~} again? I wouldn't miss it.
[MADELINE left sad]
Are you sure this is the right place?
[THEO right normal]
Looks like it. I hear this way there's a cool {n}alternate route up to that old memorial\.\.\.
[THEO right excited]
Should be fun!
[MADELINE left normal]
Alright, let's do it!
[THEO right excited]
Right on! This will be a blast!
[THEO right excited]
I'll see you at the top. Good luck!
[THEO right normal]
And one more thing, {0.25} I hear there's a load of strawberries along the way,
[THEO right thinking]
If you wanna get some of them, {n}{~}save a couple for me!{/~}

[THEO left excited]
{+MADELINE}!
[THEO left thinking]
Check out this crazy wreckage I found just laying here.
[MADELINE right surprised]
Is that a plane?
[THEO left excited]
Looks like it!
[THEO left thinking]
Hey, I wonder if there's any snacks inside.
[MADELINE right sad]
It's probably been here for years\.\.\.
[MADELINE right distracted]
I doubt there'd be anything left at all.
[MADELINE right sad]
Besides, I don't want you getting hurt.
[THEO left worried]
You're probably right, oh well.
[THEO left thinking]
This is still totally going on Instapix.


theooutro=
[THEO right excited]
{+MADELINE}! You made it!
[THEO right thinking]
Man, it's been forever since I was last up here...
[THEO right worried]
Kinda wild seeing it again. Feels different, y'know?
[MADELINE left sad]
It sure does.
[MADELINE left normal]
I'm glad you're here.

[MADELINE left distracted]
I was worried you might get hurt back there.
[THEO right worried]
...
[THEO right thinking]
I won't lie, I did have a quick {~}heart-to-heart with gravity{/~} along the way.
[MADELINE left surprised]
{!}You fell?{/!} {0.25}My god, are you alright?
[THEO right thinking]
Nothing serious, just a little slip.
[THEO right normal]
I stuck the landing though. {n}Almost {0.25}definitely{0.25} looked cool.
[MADELINE left sad]
Well, that's a relief.
[MADELINE left distracted]
I don't know what I'd do with myself if you had, {0.25}well...
[THEO right thinking]
Come on, don't have {~}that{/~} little faith{n} in my abilities.
[THEO right thinking]
Besides,
[THEO right yolo]
{~}Talk about an adrenaline rush!{/~}
[MADELINE left sad]
...
[MADELINE left normal]
Well, I'm glad you're okay.
[THEO right thinking]
Right as rain.

[THEO right excited]
Oh yeah! How are things going with {~}{+ALEX}{/~}?
[MADELINE left normal]
Can't complain.
[THEO right thinking]
Can't complain? {~}Come on{/~}, sister.
[THEO right excited]
{+ALEX} hasn't been able to shut up about you!
[MADELINE left normal]
...
[MADELINE left peaceful]
She's wonderful.
[THEO right thinking]
She really is.

[THEO right normal]
I'm glad I came out here again.
[MADELINE left normal]
Me too.
[MADELINE left sad]
Hey,
[MADELINE left distracted]
Thanks for coming out here with me.
[MADELINE left normal]
I've really needed this.
[THEO right excited]
Are you kidding? I've been wanting to {n}come back here since we left!
[MADELINE left normal]
Really? How come?
[THEO right thinking]
You want the {~}fun answer{/~}{0.25} or the honest answer?

[MADELINE left sad]
What about the real answer?
[THEO right thinking]
Well, the {~}fun answer{/~} is\.\.\.
[THEO right excited]
That these ruins are awesome!
[THEO right thinking]
Every time I see the photos I snapped last time,{n} I can't help but wanna explore them more.
It's like they {~}breathe with history{/~}. {n}Every pile of rocks has a story, y'know?
[MADELINE left sad]
...
[THEO right thinking]
Alright, maybe that's getting a {>> 0.15}{~}little{/~}{>>} carried away.
[THEO right normal]
But I do love this place. Feels like {n}it's got a pulse, y'know?
[THEO right thinking]
But, {0.25}that's not really why I came back.

[THEO right normal]
Honestly? {0.65}I've missed you, {0.15}{# F94A4A}{>> 0.6}Strawberry{#}{>>}.
[THEO right worried]
With this new job in Washington, it's been{n} hard to make time for travelling.
[THEO right normal]
But I've needed this too, more than I realised.
[THEO right normal]
I'm really glad we could do this together.
[MADELINE left normal]
Me too. It's been lovely.
[MADELINE left distracted]
Thanks for coming back here with me.
[MADELINE left sad]
{0.15}It really means a lot,{0.25} you know.
[MADELINE left normal]
Maybe, {0.15}someday, {0.15}we could climb to {n}the top of the {+Mountain} together.
The view from the top is worth {n}more than I can express.
It's really, {~}truly{/~} beautiful.
[THEO right worried]
.{0.1}.{0.1}.
[THEO right thinking]
Perhaps for now let's enjoy the view from {n}{~}the memorial{/~}, hey?
[THEO right worried]
My heart still needs to recover from {n}all the {*}excitement{/*} of getting this far.
[MADELINE left normal]
You're right. Let's rest here for the night.
What do you say?
[THEO right thinking]
I say that sounds like an {>> 0.3}{~}excellent{/~}{>>} idea.
[THEO right normal]
I'll get a fire going.

[MADELINE left normal]
...
[MADELINE left sad]
Hey, {0.25}{+THEO}?
[THEO right normal]
