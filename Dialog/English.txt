A chance to explore a {~}mysterious abandoned {n}city{/~} again? I wouldn't miss it.
[MADELINE left sad]
Are you sure this is the right place?

{+MADELINE}!
[THEO left thinking]
Check out this crazy wreckage I found just laying here.
[MADELINE right surprised]
Is that a plane?
[THEO left excited]
Looks like it!
[THEO left thinking]
Hey, I wonder if there's any snacks inside.
[MADELINE right sad]
It's probably been here for years\.\.\.
[MADELINE right distracted]
I doubt there'd be anything left at all.
[MADELINE right sad]
Besides, I don't want you getting hurt.
[THEO left worried]
You're probably right, oh well.
[THEO left thinking]
This is still totally going on Instapix.


[THEO right excited]

Kinda wild seeing it again. Feels different, y'know?
[MADELINE left sad]
It sure does.
[MADELINE left normal]
I'm glad you're here.
[MADELINE left distracted]
I was worried you might get hurt back there.
[THEO right worried]

[THEO right thinking]
I won't lie, I did have a quick {~}heart-to-heart with gravity{/~} along the way.
[MADELINE left surprised]
{!}You fell? {0.25}My god, are you alright?{/!}
[THEO right thinking]
Nothing serious, just had a little slip.
[THEO right normal]
I stuck the landing though. {n}Almost {0.25}definitely{0.25} looked cool.
[MADELINE left sad]
Well, that's a relief.
[MADELINE left distracted]
I don't know what I'd do with myself if you had, {0.25}well,
[THEO right thinking]
Come on, don't have {~}that{/~} little faith{n} in my abilities.
[THEO right thinking]

You want the {~}fun answer{/~}{0.25} or the honest answer?
[MADELINE left sad]
What about the real answer?
[THEO right thinking]
Well, the {~}fun answer{/~} is\.\.\.
[THEO right excited]
That these ruins are awesome!
[THEO right thinking]
Every time I see the photos I snapped last time,{n} I can't help but wanna explore them more.
It's like they {~}breathe with history{/~}. {n}Every pile of rubble, its own little story.
